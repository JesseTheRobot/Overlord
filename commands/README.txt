NOTES ON ADDING CUSTOM COMMANDS
1.) your command MUST used the format of the other commands, including using exports.run(...) as well as bulit in methods for data storage, etc.
as well as a valid exports.defaultConfig, where the name of the command file (correct case,no file extention)
is at index [0] of the aliases section (legacy, may be redundant later. if so, I will remove this part).
other than that, do what you like!
